  <h2>You are special. You are worthy. You have a kind of magic that can never be imitated. 
  <br>You are a blessing. You are spectacular. You are most beautiful when you are yourself.<br>

    How did these words make you feel? I'm betting on the chance that they did something to your heart.
  <br>
    It feels wonderful when someone appreciates you for who you are just as you are, doesn't it? 
  <br>When they encourage you to be yourself more and love you for it.
  <br>
    We all deserve that. But, we deserve that most from our own selves. <br>
    So, I'm glad you're here looking for words that will inspire you to be yourself. Here they are,
